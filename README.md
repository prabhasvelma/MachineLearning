Project: Titanic Survival Prediction Using Decision Tree

Description:
This project uses a decision tree algorithm to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on the Titanic.csv dataset. The results of the prediction are evaluated using a confusion matrix. The code performs supervised learning to train the model and assess its performance.

Files:
1. Titanic.csv - The dataset containing information about the Titanic passengers.
2. titanic_decision_tree.py - The main Python script that contains the code for loading the data, preprocessing, training the decision tree model, and evaluating the results.
3. README.txt - This file providing an overview of the project.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)
- seaborn (for visualization, if needed)

Steps Involved :
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:he script performs the following steps:
1. Load the Titanic.csv dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a decision tree classifier on the training set.
5. Make predictions on the testing set.
6. Evaluate the predictions using a confusion matrix and print the results.

Output:
- The confusion matrix displaying the performance of the decision tree classifier in predicting the survival of Titanic passengers.
